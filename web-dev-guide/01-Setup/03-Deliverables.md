## Important Notes

**Multiple deliverables can be selected**.

Deliverables will be generated automatically at the end of the audit using the templates from the `03-Templates/` folder.

## Deliverables vs Internal Tools

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The following are NOT separate deliverables for the client:

- **Security assessment (OWASP Top 10)**: This is an internal tool. Findings are included in deliverable #3 (Technical analysis) in the "Security: X/10" section

- **Role matrix**: This is for internal audit organization (AI perspective switching). It is NOT delivered to the client.
